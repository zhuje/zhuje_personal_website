                            Salutations! <br/><br/>

                            My name is Jenny Zhu and currently I'm a Master of Science in Computer
                            Science candidate at Northeastern University. I'm looking for a
                            software development internship or co-op between May 2021 to
                            December 2021 in the Boston area. <br/><br/>

                            Prior to joining the MSCS program, I worked as a clinical research
                            coordinator and a biology researcher studying oncology and neurology.
                            While I learned a tremendous amount working in biological research,
                            it was during this time I found an interest in computer science and
                            made a transition into the field. <br/><br/>

                            In my previous positions, I developed a host of skills that are
                            essential within Computer Science including time management and
                            strong analytical thinking. I enjoy analyzing problems and innovating
                            creative new strategies to overcome challenges. Furthermore, I thrive
                            in team-oriented settings, where communication and time management are
                            especially important. My diverse background, transferable skills,
                            and MSCS training make me a strong candidate for a variety of roles
                            within CS. <br/><br/>

                            My current goal is to further expand my software development
                            skillset particularly in the areas of human computer interactions
                            and user interfaces. During my undergraduate studies I completed a
                            minor in psychology and would love to learn more about how people
                            interact with computers and the best approaches in designing
                            applications that enhance the user experience. To facilitate this deeper
                            understanding, I am looking for an internship or co-op beginning
                            May 2021 to December 2021.<br/><br/>
