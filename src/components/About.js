                            Master of Science in Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University. Looking for a software development internship or co-op between May 2021 to December 2021 in the Boston area.

                            Prior to joining the MSCS program, I worked as a clinical research coordinator and a biology researcher studying oncology and neurology. While I learned a tremendous amount working in biological research, it was during this time I found an interest in computer science and made a transition into the field.

                            In my previous positions, I developed a host of skills that are essential within Computer Science including time management and strong analytical thinking. I enjoy analyzing problems and innovating creative new strategies to overcome challenges. Furthermore, I thrive in team-oriented settings, where communication and time management are especially important. My diverse background, transferable skills, and MSCS training make me a strong candidate for a variety of roles within CS.

                            My current goal is to further expand my software development skillset particularly in the areas of human computer interactions and user interfaces. During my undergraduate studies I completed a minor in psychology and would love to learn more about how people interact with computers and the best approaches in designing applications that enhance the user experience. To facilitate this deeper understanding, I am looking for an internship or co-op beginning May 2021 to December 2021.
