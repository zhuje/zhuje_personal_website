                            Salutations! <br/><br/>

                            My name is Jenny Zhu and currently I'm a Master of Science in Computer
                            Science candidate at Northeastern University. I'm looking for a
                            software development internship starting September 2021 through
                            the end of December 2021 in the Boston area. <br/><br/>

                            Prior to joining the MSCS program, I worked as a clinical research
                            coordinator and a biology researcher studying oncology and neurology.
                            While I learned a tremendous amount working in biological research,
                            it was during this time I found an interest in computer science and
                            made a transition into the field. <br/><br/>

                            In my previous positions, I developed a host of skills that are
                            essential within Computer Science including time management and
                            strong analytical thinking. I enjoy analyzing problems and innovating
                            creative new strategies to overcome challenges. Furthermore, I thrive
                            in team-oriented settings, where communication and time management are
                            especially important. My diverse background, transferable skills,
                            and MSCS training make me a strong candidate for a variety of roles.
